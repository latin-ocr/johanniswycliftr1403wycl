XXVI INTRODUCTION.

Is lltc known wlzercvcr ils leuower is? —- No; for then everything
would be, as God is, everywhere (133, 134). It is objected that every-
thing is truth, and that truth, like God, is everywhere. We may, how-
ever, admit this, restricting the sense os being in space to filling that space
quantilaliveb'. Thus, granting the force of the argument, we nevertheless
deny it in the signification usually given to words. Christ’s Body has size in
the sacrament, yet it does not properly fill space3 it is present without
either position or shape. The bread is not annihilated3 what remains is a
purely mathematical body, but not nothing; the sacramental sign is the
reality of Christ’s Body (134—137). It may be urged that the fact of
movement is not extended in space, and that movement is consequently
everywhere. But local movement is the movement os a body, and must
be extended with that to which it belongs. virtues, again⁷ exist throughout
the whole man, body and soul; but they are nowhere else but where
their subject is. When a part moves, the whole may be said to move,
it is true3 only in a different way (139, 140). Movement thus takes its
determination (individuacionem suam) either from its subject alone, qua
subject, or from the subject with all its integral parts, or from this with
the velocity also taken into account. The third point of view implies the
first and the second3 but not vice versa. Wherever there is a more in-
dividual movement, there is also a more universal one; and in this
sense, movement as a universal, is everywhere, according to Aristotle
(140, 141). God indeed is all truth everywhere; yet truth, as created, is
not identical with God, and it were a fallacy to draw such an inference.
The sense 01 words in these questions depends much on their position
in the sentence. “It is non) possible for a given future instant to exist³³‚
and, “It is possible for a given future instant to exist now'', are two
widely different propositions. God's knowledge of everything is absolutely
boundless. No time exists for Him. He is means He is yeslerday, or He
was to-morrows existing at once in all eternity —- an instant to Him.
— He coinprises all duration in His being (141—*14303 and therefore His
existence is an eternal Non). — Again, we have a similar sophism: “That
may necessarily be which cannot be necessarily?2 This is false, but
only when understood of absolute, not of hypothetical necessity. A
future instant is necessarily “about to be'³, at a time when it cannot
possibly he “about to be³'. All this is mere foolish subtlety; we go no
farther than to say that, if at any moment it is true that a given being
