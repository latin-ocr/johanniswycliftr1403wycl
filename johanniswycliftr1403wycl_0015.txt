[machinosum. XI

continuing to revolve round the sun, ceused to rotate on its axis. The
sun would he for ever in the sanie incridian3 but in summer it would
be seen higher in the sky — that is, nearer the North Polc; -— in
autumn, it would go lower —⁶ that is, nearcr the South Pole —- until
⁴ it (lisappenred beneath the horizon for six months. This supposition aitis
Wyclif to explain the sun's yearly apparent passage through the signs
‹›f the zodfflc, by imagining an eastward movemcnt, which in some un-
known manner is delayed to the extent of about one degree every day3
while the sun’s position in the sky changes nt the same tirnc from North
to South‚ or vice versa.

Other divisions of moventem. Wyelif here deals only with local
mox-efflent, uniform or varied; and is varied, varied either in itself or in
its subject. If the world revolves with a movement that seems uniform,
each part of the world turns round with a different degree of rapidity,
except at the poles, where the movement is nil. All these various rapi-
‹lities of movement may at once be predicated of their one subject -—
the world. It thus at the same time moves faster and slower than itself:
which of course, with the above explanation, is evidently true. Wyclif
goes farther, and asserts that the motion of a part may be equal to,
though less than, that of the whole; notwithstanding that this admission
lends a handle to sophistica] objections. A movement smaller in velocity¹
is equal to the whole movement in duration. The circular movement of
a part of the world near the poles is much less rapid than at the
Equator3 yet both take place in 24 hours (28). Movement is again either
uniformly or variably varied; and once more the old mediaeval distinction

¹ In velocity. The assertion that a part of any movement is equal to the
whole is explained in the text by the distinction: quoad molem — quoad duracionem.
Ι find it difficult to understand. The sense, as l give it above, does not, Ι confess,
agree well with quoad molem3 it ought to be quoad velocitatem. But we might
understand the words thus: Movernent in one atorn only (a part of the whole
movement quoad molem) is equal to the movement of the whole body moved. But
then, why does Wyclif use the words quoad duraciouem? They ought again in
this case to be changed for quoad velocitatem. Ι think that the explanation, as given
above, answers better to the general drift of the argument. Either way, we see how
may be maintained that a partial movement is equal to its whole, -- Ι may here,
by the way, repeat what I pointed out in the Introduction to Logica, Vol. II, viz.
that I in this analysis often introduce comparisons or remarks of may own, in order
to clear up what is not clear, or to reconcsse seeming discrepancieS.
