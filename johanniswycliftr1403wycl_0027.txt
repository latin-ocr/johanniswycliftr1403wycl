perpendicular to the liquator, i. e. those os which the curvature is the
smallest; at the same time each of them forms the smallest possible of
circles -- a point — parallel to the Equator, and of which the curva-
ture is the largest. Which of these curvatures belongs to that punctal
atom which is a pole of the world? Wyclis, noticing that the difficulty
would tell against his adversaries no less than against himself, solves it
by denying that any one circle is more curved than another; in each
circle every point of the circumference is equally distant from the
centre. —— If the liquator consist of tripunctal atonis, it cannot be a
circle. For these atoms do not form ιι curvc; they are either in line
or make up a triangle3 in either case, there is curvity. Wyclif answers
that, being points which touch each other without any distance between
thern, they form neither a triangle nor a straight line. Geometry is only
seemingly against this, because such things ure conceivable by the mind
alone, not by imagination. 'l‘hat science cannot give us absolute exacti-
tude (mo-111).

Of Augntcnlalion. -— Leaving the questions concerning local move-
ment, and coming to the movement by which, without changing its place,
a body increases in volume, Wyelif points out that augmentation, strictly
taken, means only the increase of an animated being, caused by nutrition
and by the assimilation of food (111), gives us a description of the
digestive process such as might be expected, interesting merely as a
curiosity (112, 113), and enters into a disquisition about the cause of
natural death from mere decrease of vitality (114, 115). The movement
of augmentation is not continuous any more than undulations are con-
tinuous; it is a collective entity, consisting of many movements (115, 116).
The difficulties which follow are of slight moment, and only serve to
bring in a description of the various kinds of tissue in the human body.
The rapidity of augmentation depends on the size acquired and the
time taken to acquire it (116—118').

Of Alteration. As alteration is a change in quality, grounded upon
the substantial components of each body —— matter and form, — it is
mainly Wyclif’s theory with respect to the latter that is discussed here.
Having expounded his idea of the universe -— one material being, made
up of punctal atoms, filling all possible space, and unchangeable except
in so far as one of its parts can be separated from another by local
movement —n he states that the world can be thought, jirslly, as mere
