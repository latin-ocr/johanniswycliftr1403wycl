is not in God's power that I do not exist. But when must anything
exist? At a moment known to God (179—183). The simultaneity of life
and death would, as already stated, require thern both to take place at
the very same instant. Time exists, but its parts do not all exist non),
only one at a time, Non) is but one mode of an existence which not
nom does not destroy. An instant llzcn, now, and to come exists dif-
ferently, but cannot at any time be called simply non-existent. Antichrist
must come: therefore he llas come . . . in the future. 'l‘hat is a modal,
but a real existence. It was never true that I am nol. To exist and not
to exist are contradictories; they may be true of the same being, but
not in the same Now. God knows past, present and future things with
the very same knowledge, yet this does not argue sameness in the
object known. Light is not affected by the presence or the absence
of the object illuminated. God may know present and future things as
past, if they exist in time; things eternal are eternally present; such, for
example, as the archetypes of what was, is, or is to be (183--188).
Here Wyclif again returns to 1113 adversaries’ favourite argument, viz.
that black is white, and all contraries identical. But one remark of 1113
13 worth noticing. Α proposition may be true, and yet false at any finite
part of time3 as, for instance: ‘All the instants of time exist³. This is
true only for and in endless time (188—-190,

causes all that which exists temporally⁹ The extrinsic act of God, termin-

sary; the intrinsic actos His being is eternal and changeless (191, 192).

A cause produces ils efflet before thal (jffirl exz'sls. That is, before
its existence it is producing it, but not now; in the future. The ideal
being of the effect depends upon its cause, and is produced by it
before the moment when its real existence has to be actuated. On the
other hand, cause, qna cause, and effect, are simultaneous. Many things
are neither instantaneous nor tempora13 v. g.‚ certain eternal truths, and
beings of which the existence is intermittent. Wyclif here wonders how
the writers of his time can oppose his system, which is confirmed by
the very expressions they employ; and he blesses God, who has enlightened
him that he may escape the difficulties in which they are entangled

(192—195), — The necessity of sin depends on our own free-will; the
