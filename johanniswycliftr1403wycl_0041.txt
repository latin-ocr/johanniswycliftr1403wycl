to saying that, however infallible the deductive process, however evident
the first principles from which we start, we are still liable to be mistaken‚
because things may be otherwise thanas ive lenow them lo be. To assert
that all is matter, and that even the acts of our mind are material,
notwithstanding our conscious certitude that there is an abyss between
the two, is to set down that whatever we know, no matter how indu—
bitably, may be false if it goes beyond material facts, and laws relative
to matter. Again, the statement (which would ruin Metaphysic‚ if Meta-
physic could be ruined by man) that at the bottom of all our inquiries
into first principles, we find sels—contradictions and absurdities in every
possible assertion on either side3 and that consequently though we can
know neither space nor timo, we must confine our investigations to
that which is conditioned by time and space: —- this well-known
doctrine is based upon the denial that things are as we know them.

The quarrel between Realists and Nominalists is thus an important
phase, but only a phase, of the evei-lasting struggle between two op-
posite currents of thought. I call it everlasting, for though the forms may
vary, it is likely to spring up for ever, or at least so long as human
curiosity as regards such high and abstruse matters continues to exist.

Not that there is no answer to the problem, no middle way
between the absolute affirmative of one class of philosophical thinkers,
and the uncompromising negative of the other class. But in this very
answer we find the reason why it is not universally accepted as settling
the point in dispute.

Do all things exist as they are known by us? As is a very short
word, and (it would seem on a superficial view) not equivocal in the
least. But let us consider it more closely. Things seen in a looking-
glass both are and are not as they are in reality. There is a certain
resemblance, more or less perfect; but the difference between them is
that between the image and the original. In the same way, so sar as
any comparison is possible, the human intellect is the mirror of
Nature. Our thoughts are the images of things; but we can no more
conclude that things are of the nature of our thoughts than we can
infer that a nosegay out of a looking-glass is of quicksilver amalgam‚
because in the looking-glass it is imprinted upon quicksilver„ Thus,
things exist as they are known by us: that is, we have the right,
they being the causes of our thoughts, to make certain inferences
