INTRODUCTION. XXIX

make 'all things eternal, and ‹lestroy all certitude as to the duration of
things (165, 166).

h) Nothing is, but everything either was or will be. This cuts
short disputes as to the existence of things during an infinitely brief
interval. But then, what never is, never was or will be. To God’s
knowledge nothing is in the future, so He would know, for instance,
movement to exist, and it would not be true. One hour must be the
double of half an hour; if so, there must come an instant at which this
is true in the present: i. e. when half is past, half future, and the
whole hour partly one and partly the other. Present may indeed be
taken in a wider sense than one single instant. Here Wyclif shows
clearly that, in the same way as he assumes the existence of separate
individual points as realities‚ so he also assumes the real existence of
instants‚ joined together to form time, shorter or longer, but also really
existing in another time which includes both past and future, Instead,
therefore, of a century being a present which is fictitious, consisting only
of indivisible instants before and after each of which there is the non-
existing past and the not yet existent future, the whole century forms a
real present, though real in another sense than that of the instant which
is now. And Wyclif adds that, if this be not admitted, he does not see
how the sacramental words, for instance, “Hoc ες] corpus meum'’‚ can
be true. Only an inlinitesimal part of the proposition would exist; the
whole, never3 and consequently it never would be true. To say, “Nothing
that is past or future exists’', isin reality to destroy time. God’s immut-
able knowledge ‹›f things, and His free-will, are both contrary to such
a supposition. Christ, in the Divine Essence os the Word‚ saw men long
before their temporal existence; but He saw them as existing‚ and they
did truly exist in the reality of long centuries of the future. And thus
He is rightly called, Son of David, Son of Abraham, in this real exten-
sion of time, by which David and Abraham come to be coexistent with
Him. Has a posthumous child no father at all? None, unless we grant
the real simultaneity of its existence now with the past in which its
father lived (166—170).

c) Time, though a successive quantity, can be lengthened out inde-
finitely by Almighty Power, so that one instant would be equal to ages.
This is possibly the doctrine of the aevum or instans angelicum, familiar
to Mediaeval Schoolmen, which some of them may have supposed
