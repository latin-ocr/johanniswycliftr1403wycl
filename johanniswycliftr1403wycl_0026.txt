one is continually brought into being3 take the velocity common to each
01 these at each instant, and you get the speed of the whole (96).

Here comcs a curious passage, in which Wyclif is led to state the
exact rapidity of the swiftest movement possible, viz. one point per
instant. It seems to us that, in continuous movement, whether slow or
quick, one point — an infinitely small distance — is always passed over
in the infinitely small interval of one instant. This is denied. In all move-
ments which are slower than that of the Equator of the First Mobile,
we have two, three, four . . 0 . instants during which the point is
motionless, and then passes instantaneously on to the next place, which
is infinitely near (97—99). In all these remarks, and elsewhere, as the
reader will doubtless perceive, there is a dim perception 01 the non-
equality 01 infinitesimal quantities; but the state 01 Mathematies was not
then sufficiently advanced to foster the idea, and Wyclif himself, though
far in advance ‹›f his time, was more 01 a metaphysician than osa
mathematician. His conception, 11 carried into the field of pure Mathe-
matics, might possibly have had good results; understood in the Realistic
sense, they came to nothing.

A logical quibble about the possibility of instantaneous change
(whether, between the instant 01 changing and that of having changed,
there is any interval) brings our author to a short digression upon death,
which takes place in two ins-tants. In the first, the man dies; in the
second, he is dead, for we cannot say, lte is dead at the instant when
he dies, 1101-Ιιι7 (lies at the instant when he is dead. Other writers
would say that the instant 01 death is the same in both cases; but
viewed from different standpoints: as the end of life, and the beginning
01 non—life. This, Wyclif says, is impossible (100).

Astronomicczl oly'ecfz'ons. ---- The assertion that the Equator alone
moves one point per instant is beset with many difficulties. The First
Mobile is a perfect sphere; its movements therefore ought at all points,
and not only at the Equator, to be uniform. But every point in the First
Mobile does not touch every other: so the smaller circles, making a
shorter journey in the same time, will not require to move so fast. The
circle tangent to the liquator has but one point fewer than the Equator;
performing its journey in the same time, it will remain immobile for one
instant, to make up sor the missing point: which of the points is missing
we need not enquire. —— The Poles belong to the great circles,
