VIII INTRODUCTION.

created, is absolutely necessary. A further proof is in the impossibility
os 11 vacuum: if 3 piece of bread be annihilated‚ what remains in its
place? Nothing thinkable3 and, therefore, annihilation is unthinkable too.

Wyclif is thus forced to deny that anything can be annihilated,
even by Almighty Power‚ even absolutely consult-rem· and here we see
the profound difference which separates him from the general opinion
01 Scholastic philosophers and theologiam, who ‹listinguish between
what is possible to Omnipotence‚ irrespectively of God's other attributes,
but are not all osone mind as to whether 3111111111311011 15 absolutely

second book 01 Ρ31·3(1156 Lost:

ssut Wyclif has no doubt 31 311 011 1116 matter.

Now, in the doctrine of Transubstantiation‚ it is affirmed that the
bread caeses lo exist. This (though some Doctors 01 great note, Aquinas
amongst others⁷ explain 11 111 3 different manner) certainly seems to point
to annihilation‚ 35 was very probably admitted by Wyclif’s Nominalistic
opponents. At any rate, the assertion that the whole substance of the
bread ceases to exist at 3 given instant — both as to its substantial
qualities and the underlying substratum 01 those qualities -— could, in
Wyclif's system, be understood only as the annihilation of the atoms 01
which it consists. This had to be denied. The bread‚ it was affirmed,
ceased to exist αδ bread; in its place there remained 3 body that
Wyclif (no doubt out 01 respect for the dogma which he still seemed
to admit) called a corpus mathematicmn. Ι say, ‘still seemed to admit';
for, 35 we have seen, this corpus mathematicum, quite orthodox enough in
the ordinary sense of the words, is nothing else but the atoms, or mathe-
matical points, of which the bread consists‚ just as they were before.
Any one who will read p. 137 of the present volume will, Ι think, be
convinced that the successive stages 01 Wyclif's opinions in this matter,
35 given by Wodeford (see De Benedicta luem-nacione, ecl. Mr. Harris,
[nt. IX.) were successive only in the mode 01 expression, not in the
thing itself. The same esse, he says. which was previously that of bread,
