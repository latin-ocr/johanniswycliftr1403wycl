work comes to a close. All that should be said as regards the genuineness
of the work und its date has already been said in the Introduction to
Vol. 1, and there is no need to repeat it here. As to the state of the

all those who have aided me in the work; especially Dr, Furnivall, the
Founder of the Wyclif Society; and Mr. Matthew‚ whose notes have
more than once been of great service.

The two Chapters of Wyclif's book which make up the present
volume were also copied as separate tractates. The last chapter,
however, dealing with time, is quite distinct from the treatise Dc [1ιεῖίυί-

examination of the contents of these two chapter-s, I think it advisable
to notice several matters of importance which may strike the reader on
a perusal of the whole.
