XVIII INTRODUCTION.

of space were filled with indivisible impenetrable atonis, should anything
increase in size‚ the whole universe would become larger than it can
possibly be. Yet rarefaction must be admitted; and a like argument has
the same weight as regards condensation. Wyclif, in his reply‚ at once
declares that he does not admit the possibility of a body occupying
more or less space without gain or loss of matter. Rarefacffion, there-
fore, and condensation also, are denied in this sense, but admitted in
another. On account of the accession or the removal of another body,
a substance ma)v seem to increase or diminish in size3 aS‚ v. g.‚ smoke
seems to spread itself out and fill a room, whereas it is in reality mixed
with the air. This is the only sense in which rarefaction is possible,
and it answers all the ‹'›l)jections. &Vc need not follow our author through
the mazes of Modiaeval physics which hc tlirvads, nor inquire whether
this view would destroy all differcncte between tln· ‹elements of sire, air,
water and earth (03—70). Wyclif ends by stating‚ as his opinion, that
the compi-netratitm of two bodies 15 an utter impossibility. This conclu-
sion evidcntly flows from his doctrino. 'l‘wo points, having 110 (1111161151011111
