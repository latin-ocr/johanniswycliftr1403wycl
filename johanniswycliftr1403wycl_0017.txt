to tlie same conclusion (32). -- 6. There are days and nights but oiie
instant long (as at the poles). These days and nights are part of the
coiitinuity of time, and yet are distinct from the. rest of it; therefore they
are real parts, which make up tliat continuity. And if'l‘ime is tlius com-
posed, it is easy to show that space is composed likewise (33). —
7. If God, by His almighty Power, created a series of substances each
the size of a mathematical point, and placed them side by side throughout
the whole of space, we should have continuous extensioii3 and nothing
can be brought to prove that what is possible in this case is not a
really existing fact (34). —— Throughout the whole of these arguments⁷ our
author seems at times to take the idea of tlie absolutely inextended point
— the Nothing of Space — ziiid at others, that of a line divided by
“a quantity that has increased beyond all measure³³. The latter, accord-
ing to modern mathematicians, is not absolutely without length3 only
its length is shorter than the sliortest line conceivable. Such infinitesimal
magiiitudes would indeed be factors of the line; but would they agree

with Wyclif's conception of the point, as an absolute minimum of bulk?

The line A, divided by 00, gives A; but 2 A, divided in like manner,

gives -0-0—; the second quantity is mathematically double of the first. But
Ι leave these considerations to such as are versed in a scicnce which,
since five hundred years, has made such progress as Wyclif never
dreamed of.

Argumentis contra: Aristotle’s view. — The difficulties which surround
such a system are of course great and manifold. Aristotle seems against
it3 for instance, when he says that the Continuous is infinitely divisihle.
But, a) Aristotle speaks of that which is continuous to our senses3 and
that, so far as our senses can tell, is indeed made up of innumerable
parts. But though infinite for us, they are not so to God. And, h) Ari-
stotle distinctly says that the point is the cause of the line; isso, it
must be its element‚ and this dictum is quite in Wyclif's favour (35).
The doctrine of indivisible points transcends both our senses and our
imagination. Geometry has nothing to do here, these points are beyond
geometry; physics are out of court, they belong to metaphysic. God
alone knows how many points go to form a given square, but their

number is not infinite to Him (36). The word ‘Infinite’ is used to denote
