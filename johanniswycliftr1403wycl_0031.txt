will exist, the being is in the future (143-145). At different times that
which is white is black, 3 111311 differs from himself, &c.; but this implies
no absurdity. Becorning is a change, not of the subject, but of its
‘suchness’ An instantaneous change does not imply an inlinitely swift
movement, for the idea of swiftness implies that of time, not of one
instant only (145—147).

A great many fallacies 316 brought forward against this position,
such as that, v. g., if future whiteness be always predicable of an indi-
vidual, that individual will always be white; so that if at any time he
were black, he would have and not have two essential contradictory
qualities; or that a king cannot have been baptized, if, when baphzed,
he was not yet 3 king; and soon ad t'ufinilnm. They 311 belong to the
class of fallaciae accidentis. c‘What you have bought, you have eaten;
but you have bought raw meat3 therefore you have caten raw meat.'³
The change from black to white is one, not of nature, but of quality.
The individual differs fron] himself inodally, not essentially. The ‘being a
king' is in a man a mere accidental quality; the king has been baptized,
not as a king, but as a man. “He who is now a king, was baptized
when not a king³’‚ is perfectly true. Much depends on the compound
or the divided sense in which terms may be taken. “He wlzo is hegotlen
is David llze king3 David tlte king and who is begonem belong, 35 pre-
dicates, to the verb is, in the divided, not in the compound sense.
Resides, the act of begetting is not instantaneous; it has many pre-
paratory acts (147—154). —— There are also several theological argu-
ments on p. 150, concerning the possibility of God’s assuming the per-
sonality of 311 6163111165, which Wyclif briessy meets by denying (154,
155) in direct opposition to Aquinas (Sum. Th. p. 3ἃ qu.111. art. 5, 6).

Are all things together, both in time and place? — Wyclif first
of all gives the arguments contra. If it were so, there would no longer
be any distance between things. The future 31111 1116 past would exist
eternally; 3 111311 would both exist and not exist in the 531116 (61611131)
time. Again‚ whatever takes place in any part of space and time, must
take place there only and only then3 its existence cannot possibly be
extended any farther (155). On the other hand, the world is everywhere;
yet the whole world is not in any part of space3 and in like manner,
if anything exists at any time, its llzen existence is true in all time; and
so also of space (156). -—- Wyclif thinks that this question arises mainly
