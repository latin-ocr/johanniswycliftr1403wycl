Loca] proposition& Place may be taken to mean merely position (Ι).

nor moved, nor changed 111 31111116. The whole of space is the whole
world; 1111111111 31111663 111-6 made up of points. 'l‘o each point corresponds

enter it, 0116 after the 011161 (1, 2). It is a mere relation 01 distance
from the poles and the 6611116 011116 world (3). The universe is the
common 1111166 01 everything3 yet each 01113 113113 has its own 1111111111
3116 (3, 4). Two bodies may 111113 116 111 1116 3111116 111366 111 0116 361136,
and in 1111011161, 111 quite different and separate places (5). Site and situa-
tion are not identical, except at the poles and at the centre (6). Posi-

Animals, like 1116 world, have in themselves these differences 01 position:
above, below, back, 110111, right and 1611 (7—11).

3111116 body has two different movements at once (ὠν-18).) Not according
to strict logic; but one movement may be considered as the combination
of two others, and rest, as the result of two equal and contrary mo-
tions (18—23). Every change which makes 3 body to differ from what
it was, deserves to be called movement 111 3 wide sense; and in a sense
still wider, the activity of the intellect and the action (11 God upon His

is represented by the space it would pass through in a given time, if
not prevented. The impediment only counteracts the external effects
which movement tends to cause, and therefore must count for nothing,
even when 30 great as totally to destroy the effect (25). Supposing
the sun to have 11 retrograde rnovement on the 6616311111 sphere as rapid
as the sorward motion of the sphere 113611, there would be no apparent
motion 01 1116 31111 from east to west, though it would move from north
to south (26). Wyclif here 1111111163 10 1116 1361 11131 1116 31111 13 higher in
