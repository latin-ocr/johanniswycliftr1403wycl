XX INTRODL‘CTION.

each other until the final evolution of the elements. All this time the
elements were in potentia —- remolissz'nm, remota, proximam· then
in actu primo remoto, in aclzt primo proximo, and at last in actu
secundo.

Wyclif continues to urge the point against his adversaries. If we
get the elements out of the cmnpound, they must have been there before3
and many instances go to prove that they actually exist there3 sor
instance, the phosphorescence 01 sishes' scales in the dark is attributable
to the actual existence of sire (77). And as a fact, we find in combina-
tions the same qualities as were before in the elements; or if not, a
mean between them; or their reaction in the compound may even pro-
duce a quality. There is no need to suppose that the former ‹lualities
are destroyed because they do not appear (78, 79). I have added the
last clause as the 111181161- 01 such philosophers as dispute with 1116,
modern 'l‘homists, who point 0111 that carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen
are harmless, and that prussic acid is a violent poison. The poisonous
quality is merely the reaction upon each other of various qualities of
the three component elements.

To this the adversaries reply that such a compound would be but
a mere aggregate of atoms ‘which a man that had the lynx's eyes might
see separate'. Wyclif’s answer is that 01 1116 modern chemical s‹·ll‹›ol;
they are not mere aggregates: mlta! ιΙζῇΞίἰἸιΙῐαίιἚ lltc‘ componun! is lltc
relative posz'lion os 0711Ὶ alon! lo anoz‘lzca· (80). But, it is urged, if the
elemental forms are everywhere in the compound, the superadded form
os Νη) compound must 1161101111616. Wyclifreplies that this form is every-
where in the whole, and to a certain extent, indivisibly so, being less
material than the elementary forms. 'l‘hert¹ is something of the universal
in these higher forms, which exist partially in uach atoni, considered as
part of the compound (80—81). - One last difficulty. In this system,
the whole world is one being3 and one only, since all points touch,
from the centre to the extreme point where space ceases to be possible.
—- It is quite true, answers Wyclif, that the world is one being3 but it
does not follow that everything in the world is one. One being may be
separated from another by a third. Continuity does not mean sameness
01 nature. Every part 01 1116 world joins in and aids the harmonious
action of the whole; all things are made for inan, and it is sor that

reason that all the elements concur to form his organs of sense, and
